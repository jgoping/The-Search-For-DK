Python game using Pygame Library

This is a first-person game with a map system based on an undirected graph where the player walks around my basement looking for a randomly hidden stuffed monkey. Use W, A, S, and D to move around and the mouse to click on the monkey when you see it. The location changes everytime you play, so try replaying it.
