Python game using Pygame Library

This is a first-person game with a map system based on an undirected graph where the player walks around a basement looking for a randomly hidden stuffed monkey. Use W, A, S, and D to move around and the mouse to click on the monkey when you see it. The location changes everytime you play, so try replaying it.

To download pygame in order to run the program, go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. Enjoy!

I do not own the rights to Donkey Kong, it was just a stuffed animal that was lying around at the time.
